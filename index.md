I am a second year Thesis Master's student at the University of Waterloo, studying under Christopher Batty.
I am a member of both the [Computational Motion Group](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~c2batty/#team) and 
the [Computer Graphics Lab](https://cgl.uwaterloo.ca/).
My work currently is in physics-based animation, but I am interested in the application of solving PDEs to 
other domains. My current thesis work is in grid-based elasticity simulation.

I am currently applying to PhD programs. If you are interested in working with me, please reach out!

I completed my undergraduate degree in Software Engineering in 2022 at the University of Waterloo. I have 
completed internships at Autodesk Research, the Institute of Quantum Computing, and NVIDIA. For more 
information on my work and research experience, check out my CV!

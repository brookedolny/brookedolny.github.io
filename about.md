Hi, I'm Brooke! Welcome to my blog. I'm a Software Engineering student (BSE) at
the University of Waterloo, who enjoys programming, learning math, and playing hockey.

My current interests are algebra, cryptography, and security.
I'm currently working on my [personal cryptography library](https://github.com/brookedolny/Encryption),
which I've been working on as a way to explore the world of cryptography.
You can find my other projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/brookedolny) as well.

Hi, I'm Brooke. I am a Master's student studying physics-based animation at the University of Waterloo.
I am supervised by [Christopher Batty](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~c2batty/) and am a member of the Computational 
Motion Group. I am a student in the [CGL](https://cgl.uwaterloo.ca/people.html) at UWaterloo. I graduated with 
a Bachelor of Software Engineering from the University of Waterloo in 2022.

I am currently working on efficient grid-based elasticity simulation. I'm interested in physics-based animation,
game and physics engines, and efficient software architecture. I spend my free time
drawing, reading, playing hockey, and occasionally speedrunning.

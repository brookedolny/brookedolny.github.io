Hi! I'm Brooke. Welcome to my blog, where I talk about random things I find interesting.
This is my first post here.

I'm a Software Engineering Student (BSE) at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada.
I enjoy learning new math and programming, but I also enjoy playing ice hockey
from time to time.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/brookedolny) and on

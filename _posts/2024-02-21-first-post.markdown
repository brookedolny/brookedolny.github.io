Hi, I'm Brooke. At the time of writing this, I am a graduate student at the University of Waterloo
pursuing a Masters of Mathematics in Computer Science. When I was an undergraduate student, I really wanted 
to make a blog.
A blog is a great way to document my experiences, learning progress, project, and work experience. 
Github pages is great for that, since I could basically just 
type up markdown pages with whatever content I wanted and jeykll would take care of the difficult website generation
part.

My main issue with having a blog is that I struggle to think of what to write. 
I originally set up this website to document some of my projects and topics I learned about
when I was an undergraduate student, back in 2018. As I got busier with my studies and work terms, my ability to 
keep up with my small blog faded. However, I've wanted to have a place where I can talk in depth about projects I've
worked on. Perhaps these posts will be useful to you as well, and maybe you can avoid some of the pitfalls I 
encoutered years ago.

As the winter break started, I found myself returning to old media pieces that I had enjoyed as a teenager.
I'm just beginning my last term of my Master's degree, 
and rewatching shows has been genuinely relaxing and enjoyable.
One of my favourite shows in high school was Doctor Who - 
which I started watching almost a decade after its initial release.
As someone who has watched the episodes from these seasons multiple times, 
and have introduced several friends to the show,
I thought I would share my thoughts on the initial four series. 
I will probably go back and watch the remaining seasons,
but having to write about eleven seasons of a show is daunting at best.

## Season 1

The first season starts with Christopher Eccleston as the ninth doctor. Doctor who had been on a 
decade-long hiatus, and this gap was resolved by introducing a great and never-ending "time war" between
two great civilizations - the Time Lords and the Daleks. For those unfamiliar, the Doctor is part of the 
race of Time Lords - an ancient civilization that learned how to travel in time and space and thus became 
the guardians of the so-called laws of time. They are often arrogant and don't interfere with tragic events
that unfold within other less-advanced civilizations. The Daleks are a geonocidal race engineered for war, 
who seek to destroy any other living race until they alone reign supreme. The creator of the Daleks sought 
to end war by ensuring that no one could truly defeat his people. At the end of this war, there is no victor 
- all the Daleks and Time Lords are dead, except the Doctor. 

This explaination of the gap between the "old who" and "new who" seasons is acceptable, though 
I don't suppose it's easier to explain a ten year hiatus in a convincing way. The doctor being the 
last of his species gives his character an intense aura of grief that follows him through every adventure.
He is clearly running from his past, but it's unclear where he hopes his journey will go. Of course, we
don't know he's the last of his species at the start of the series - we only learn that during the
second episode.

The first episode of season one is honestly brilliant - it doesn't start with the Doctor. It starts by 
following a shop worker named Rose. She is a seemingly ordinary girl in her twenties who lives in a 
flat with her mom. She gets up at 7am, goes to work her shift, meets her boyfriend for lunch - a seemingly 
normal day that the majority of viewers can relate to. Everything seems until she goes to give

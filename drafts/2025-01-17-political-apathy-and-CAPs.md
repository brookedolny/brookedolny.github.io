title:  Political Apathy and Collective Action Problems
description: A common element in political problems is that they often require collective effort, but the vast majority of people view their individual effort as unimpactful to the large-scale solution. However, the scale of people using an argument about their individual impact being small contribute to large-scale phenomena. This is seen with voting, climate change, environmental problems, which are all collective action problems.

Why should you vote? It's maybe not a good question, because a lot of the answers to that question
are overused. You should vote because other people can't, you should vote because you're priviliged, 
you should vote because its engaging with a democratic process. I don't find these arguments convincing 
and generally avoid hurling them at people. I do think people should vote though.
Personally, I find it annoying when people who _can_ vote _don't_, but complain about election outcomes.
This of course doesn't apply to people who _can't_ vote. Anyone with a prior felony conviction can't 
vote in the United States, people often face access barriers to voting that disproportionatly affect 
low income communities, people don't have access to identification needed to vote. People who are in these
affected groups should be upset they can't vote, and they should have the right to. So then, if 
the reasons I gave above are not my justification for thinking people should vote, why do I think this?
